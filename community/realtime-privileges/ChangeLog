Changes with 4:
	* Add an allowed nice value of -11 for the realtime group. This is required
	e.g. for pipewire.

Changes with 3:
	* Remove access to hpet0 and rtc0 for the realtime group as access is not
	required in recent kernels and can be rather detrimental.

Changes with 2:
	* Fixed a typo in the udev rule.

Changes with 1:
	* Adding dedicated 'realtime' group using sysusers.d.
	* Adding limits.conf drop in file. This adds rtprio 98 and memlock unlimited
		for the realtime group.
	* Adding access to /dev/cpu_dma_latency for group 'realtime' with the help
		of a udev rule. This enables applications to stop the CPU from going to
		idle states.
